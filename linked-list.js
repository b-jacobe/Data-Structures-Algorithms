/**
 * Practice module for linked list in JavaScript
 * 
 * [Linked List](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/data-structures/linked-list)
 * A linked list is a linear collection of data elements
 * in which linear order is not given by their physical
 * placement in memory but instead have each element
 * point to the next via a group of nodes.
 *   - Pros:
 *      • Efficient insertion or removal of elements
 *        from any position in sequence during iteration.
 *   - Cons:
 *      • Access time is linear and difficult to pipeline.
 *      • Not greate cache locality.
